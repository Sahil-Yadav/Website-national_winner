              <p>Internet has burst into our lives. Since the late Sixties, when it was just a network of interconnected computers at a handful of universities to share computing resources, until today, when one in three people on the planet is a user, The Internet permeates almost every aspect of our work. Now we are not only connected for a few minutes a day, but many of us are connected forever. We not only receive and send e-mails, but also form social networks, shop online, interact with authorities and even relax on the web.<br>

                Internet freedom is a collective term that includes digital rights, freedom of information, the right to Internet access, freedom from Internet censorship, and net neutrality. <br>
                <b class="bMore" style="font-size: 0px;"></b>Internet Freedom has helped to highlight the role of freedom of expression, protection of privacy, and the free flow of information online. </b><br>
                There are several initiatives that strive for Internet Freedom, but it seems relevant to highlight those carried out by the United States Department of State, which have been incorporated as a component of the country’s foreign policy. The Internet Freedom approach is not limited to the United States; other countries have also adopted it. For e.g. After the unleash of revolutions in Northern Africa and the Middle East known as the Arab Spring, many countries saw the need to prepare their own version of Internet Freedom. <br>
                Some believe that Internet freedom is not a human right. They think this because putting something like Internet freedom as a human right could weaken what human rights stand for. But in India the court took the view that the right to be able to access the internet has been read into the fundamental right to life and liberty, as well as privacy under Article 21. <br>
                <b class="bMore" style="font-size: 0px;"></b>Right to access the internet is an essential part of right of freedom of speech and expression. </b>

              <p>As political engagement increasingly takes place online, basic freedoms that many take for granted including free expression, freedom of information and freedom of assembly are undermined if some citizens have access to the internet and others do not. Therefore, Free Internet should be provided.<br>

                  The internet provides infinite levels of knowledge to anyone who seeks it. No longer constrained to the information provided by the books that we have access to, we can now find the answer to anything in under one second by using the internet.

                  One of the greatest powers of the internet is that of connectivity. This allows people from all over the world to engage in vibrant online communities, to connect with others from every corner of the world and to communicate with individuals that they would not otherwise have chance to speak with.
  
                  <b class="bMore2" style="font-size: 0px;"><u class="bMore2" style="font-size: 0px;"><li class="bMore2" style="font-size: 0px;">Freedom and choice</b></u></li>
                  The internet brings freedom to its users in many ways; it gives people the freedom to learn what they want, to speak with whom they choose, to air their opinions, and even to work with people they have never, and will never meet. Free internet gives people the power to choose what they spend their money on, as well as ensuring they get the best deal or the best value that they possibly can.
  
                  <b class="bMore2" style="font-size: 0px;"><u class="bMore2" style="font-size: 0px;"><li class="bMore2" style="font-size: 0px;">People Power</b></u></li>
                  The internet is well-known as a platform where people can discuss issues, politics, society, economy, and other matters, as well as giving a platform for change-makers to flourish. If the internet is free, everyone in the world has an equal opportunity to have their voice heard, to educate themselves each other and to come together to fight for change, where change is needed.<br>
  
                  Though India has not yet provided each if its citizen, the free internet but it is continuously making efforts to do so. For e.g. With this, Kerala has become the first state in the country to offer free broadband internet to citizens below the poverty line (BPL) through optic fibre.

            <div class="about-one-text">
              <p>Richard Stallman is a software developer and software freedom activist. In 1983 he announced the project to develop <u><b>the GNU operating system</u></b>, a Unix-like operating system meant to be entirely free software, and has been the project's leader ever since. With that announcement Stallman also launched the free software movement. Stallman has been awarded an Innovator, a category that recognizes and honours those who have made significant

                                    technological, commercial, or policy improvements that have aided in the expansion of the Internet's reach.<br>
                  <b class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">Efforts:</b><br>
                  Stallman has written many essays on software freedom and is a voice of action in the free software movement. Since the early 1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time as a political campaigner and his speeches reflect this. He most often speaks on these three topics:<br>
                  <ul class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">
                  <li class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">"The GNU project and the Free Software movement"</li>
                  <li class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">"The Dangers of Software Patents"</li>
                  <li class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">"Copyright and Community in the age of computer networks"</li>
                  <li class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">In 1999, Stallman called for development of a free on-line encyclopaedia through the means of inviting the public to contribute articles. See GNUPedia. </li>
                  <li class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">In 2006, during the year-long public consultation for the drafting of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, he's added a fourth topic explaining the proposed changes. </li>
                  <li class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">In August 2006 at his meetings with the government of the Indian State of Kerala, he persuaded officials to discard proprietary software, such as Microsoft's, at state-run schools. </li>
                  <li class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">He pioneered the concept of copyleft, and is the main author of the GNU General Public License, the most widely used free software license. He also co-founded the League of programming Freedom. </li></ul><br>
                  <b class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">Initiatives:</b><br>
                  <ul class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">
                  <li class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">In the 1980s, he founded the GNU Project to create a free Unix-like operating system, and has been the project's lead architect and organizer. </li>
                  <li class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">Stallman's renowned software accomplishments include developing the original Emacs, GNU Emacs, the GNU Compiler Collection, and the GNU Debugger. </li>
                  <li class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">In October 1985 he started the Free Software Foundation. </li>
                  He co-founded the League for Programming Freedom. </li></ul><br>

                  Stallman had a great regard for privacy of users, he quoted:<br>
                  <b class="bMore30" style="font-size: 0px;">"Now that we have made the Internet work, the next task is to stop it from being a platform for massive surveillance, and make it work in a way that respects human rights, including privacy."</b><br>
                  He was one of the greatest contributors in the field of Internet and this is evident from the fact that he was awarded The Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society to publicly recognize his significant contributions to the development and advancement of the global open Internet.</p>

              <p>
                The term open source alludes to something individuals can adjust and share since its plan is freely accessible. The term started within the setting of computer program improvement to assign a particular approach to making computer programs. Nowadays, be that as it may, "open source" assigns a broader set of values—what we call "the open-source way." Open-source ventures, items, or activities grasp and celebrate standards of open trade
                , collaborative interest, fast prototyping, straightforwardness, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.<br>
                Open-source computer program is computer program with source code that anybody can assess, alter, and enhance. "Source code" is the portion of program that most computer clients do not ever see; it's the code computer software engineers can control to alter how a chunk of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Software engineers who have get to a computer program's source code can make strides that program by including highlights to it or settling parts that do not continuously work accurately.<br>

                    Numerous individuals lean toward open-source computer program since they have more control over that kind of program. They can look at the code to create beyond any doubt it's not doing anything they do not need it to do, and they can alter parts of it they do not like<br>

                    <b class="bMore40" style="font-size: 0px;">Linux®</b><br>
                    Linux is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system’s hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.<br>

                    <li class="bMore40" style="font-size: 0px;">Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system. </li>
                    <li class="bMore40" style="font-size: 0px;">As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computer’s hardware. </li>
                    <li class="bMore40" style="font-size: 0px;">Companies and individuals choose Linux for their servers because it's secure, flexible ,powerful, and you can receive excellent support from a large community of users. </li>
                    <li class="bMore40" style="font-size: 0px;">Linux tends to contain the best suite of low-level tools like sed, grep, awk piping, and so on. Tools like these are used by programmers to create things like command-line tools, etc. </li></ul><br>

                    <b class="bMore40" style="font-size: 0px;">Ubuntu</b><br>
                    Ubuntu is a complete Linux operating system, freely available with both community and professional support. The Ubuntu community is built on the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto: that software should be available free of charge, that software tools should be usable by people in their local language and despite any disabilities, and that people should have the freedom to customize and alter their software in whatever way they see fit.<br>
                    <ul class="bMore40" style="font-size: 0px;">
                    <li class="bMore40" style="font-size: 0px;">Ubuntu will always be free of charge, and there is no extra fee for the “enterprise edition”, we make our very best work available to everyone on the same Free terms. </li>
                    <li class="bMore40" style="font-size: 0px;">Ubuntu includes the very best in translations and accessibility infrastructure that the Free Software community has to offer, to make Ubuntu usable by as many people as possible. </li>
                    <li class="bMore40" style="font-size: 0px;">Ubuntu is shipped in stable and regular release cycles; a new release will be shipped every six months. Every two even years an Ubuntu long term support (LTS) release will become available, that is supported for 5 years. The Ubuntu releases in between (known as development or non-LTS releases) are supported for 9 month each. </li>
                    <li class="bMore40" style="font-size: 0px;">Ubuntu is entirely committed to the principles of open source software development; we encourage people to use open source software, improve it and pass it on. </li></ul>

            <div class="about-one-text">
              <p>Julian Assange, an Australian editor, used his genius IQ to hack into the databases of many high-profile organizations. In 2006, Assange began work on WikiLeaks, a website intended to collect and share confidential information on an international scale. The site officially launched in 2007 and it was run out of Sweden at the time because of the country's strong laws protecting a person's anonymity. Later that year, WikiLeaks released a U.S. military manual that provided detailed information on the Guantanamo detention canter. WikiLeaks also shared emails from then-vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin that it received from an anonymous

                <span id="more5">
                                    source in September 2008.<br>
                  Although he earned the Time magazine "Person of the Year" title in 2010 but he is an example that how improper handling of internet can lead someone behind the bars 	<br>
                  Julian Assange was not arrested because he sexually assaulted women in Sweden – that case was dropped in 2017. Assange was arrested because of what his organisation, WikiLeaks, had been doing for years and the impact it had on those in power. WikiLeaks has played catalyst to the greatest worldwide anti-corruption and transparency drive in recent decades. It exposed to the world the real face of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the torture of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, the diplomatic cables of the US State Department leading to enormous international backlash and criticism, to name a few. <br>
                  <b class="bMore3" style="font-size: 0px;">Our opinion </b><br>
                  Julian Assange, no doubt, was one of the greatest technological minds but the mistakes made by him and the crimes committed by him like the stealing of tens of thousands of emails by Russian hackers from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016 US election with the help of his website and helping people like Edward Snowden to flee from govt. made him unpopular and hated by people. <br>
                  <b class="bMore3" style="font-size: 0px;">What could have been better?</b><br>
                  Assange had violated the terms of his asylum and they arrested Assange on the basis of a US extradition warrant. In 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917.Had he not violated the terms of Asylum and the act, he would not have been remembered as a “miserable hacker” but a person with great endeavour who tried his best for the betterment of Internet facilities and conditions. This gives us message that it takes a lot of efforts to reach to the top but a small blunder can ruin everything and Issues related with Internet should be handled with care<br>

                Edward Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is a computer programmer who worked as a subcontractor for the National Security Agency (NSA). Snowden collected top-secret documents regarding NSA domestic surveillance practices that he found disturbing and leaked them. Snowden had done a no. of jobs like a security guard at the University of Maryland's Centre for Advanced Study of Language, an information-technology job at the Central Intelligence Agency, a subcontractor in

                  an NSA office in Japan before being transferred to an office in Hawaii.<br>
                  The U.S. government soon responded to Snowden's disclosures legally. On June 14, 2013, federal prosecutors charged Snowden with "theft of government Property," "unauthorized communication of national defence information" and "wilful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person. "The last two charges fall under the Espionage Act. Before President Barack Obama took office, the act had only been used for prosecutorial purposes three times since 1917. Since President Obama took office, the act had been invoked seven times as of June 2013.<br>
                  While some decried Snowden as a traitor, others supported his cause. More than 100,000 people signed an online petition asking President Obama to pardon Snowden by late June 2013.The U.S. has charged Snowden with violations of the Espionage Act, while many groups call him a hero. These two stories tell us that handling Internet is not a child’s play and every step we take has a significant consequence.<br>
                  <b  class="bMore60" style="font-size: 0px;">Our opinion</b><br>
                  He collected top-secret documents regarding NSA domestic surveillance practices that he found disturbing and leaked them. He also violated the Espionage Act, like Assange which made him look as a “Traitor” in people’s view. He definitely was a mastermind who changed the internet and hacking scenario completely.<br>
                  <b class="bMore60" style="font-size: 0px;">What could have been better?</b><br>
                  If Edward had avoided downloading thousands of documents classified Top Secret illegally, which made him flee from the country and remain in exile in Moscow, he would have reached many great heights instead of being tagged with the status of “whistle blower” or “traitor”. This gives us a message that every step we take, we should think about the future consequences associated with it.

Whether it may be a right held as it were by citizens as it were or by people generally? In the event that it is taken within the previous sense, at that point it recommends the proper is just statutory and in the event that caught on within the last mentioned, a kind of human right.

                As restricted to typically the contention of one of the fathers of the web, Mr. Vinton G. Cerf. He contended that whereas the web is exceptionally vital, in any case, it cannot be raised to the status of a human right. Innovation, concurring to him, is an enabler of rights and not a right in and of itself. The important work out of the correct to opportunity of discourse and expression over the medium of web is subordinate, constantly and inseparably, upon the get to the accessible foundation. Framework in turn depends upon social and financial variables such as the distribution of assets; the approaches of the State and its intercession within the nature of direction of assets.
